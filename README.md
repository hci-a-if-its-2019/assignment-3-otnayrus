# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) 
> and an additional novice-participant with different demographics if possible.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Operating the Prototype
Remaked hi-fi prototype using Adobe XD. Linked the prototype demonstration below.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
> In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
> Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
> You also need to invite one more novice participant.
> As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
> You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### 1. Brief Description of Participants
> Describe your participants in bullets or sentences.
> The description should contain their demographic (age, gender, occupation),
> their skill level in using the system, and your reasons choosing them.
> The description should NOT contain any personally identifiable information.

#### a. Description of Participant 1
- Male, 19 years old
- Currently studying at Marine Engineering ITS.
- Is the participant from the previous CI.
- Selecting this participant because he is a novice, and have no experience in using Any.do mobile application. 

#### b. Description of Participant 2
- Male, 20 years old
- Currently studying at Information Systems Undip.
- Selecting this participant to add perspective from a mid-skilled person, but doesn't have any experience operating this mobile app.

### 2. Evaluation Script
> Write the questions you ask and the instructions you use to direct the participants on what to do.
> If it is the same as previous assignments, please mention this, yet go ahead and INCLUDE it again,
> so we have everything in one place.
> Note that the evaluation script must include exactly what you plan to say to the participants.

1. Comment about overall home display.
2. Try to sort the activities based on name.
3. Try to filter the activities based on tags.
4. Try to search the activities based on 'Beli' keyword.

### 3. Transcript
> Provide a summary of what the participant did and said, and what you did and said.
> If at some points you have to help the participants, because they cannot figure out what to do,
> that scene must be included in the transcript.
> It is not necessary to write down every word the participant said,
> just what is interesting and useful.
> Ensure to write down all the actions on the device, whether correct or wrong.
> Remember to supplement the transcript with time-codes or line-numbers.

#### a. Transcript with Participant 1
 1. **You**: Kali ini hampir sama yang seperti dulu, silakan beri komentar sejelas-jelasnya, misalkan ada yang positif silakan dikomentari, kalau misalkan ada yang negatif disebutkan, bagus lagi kalau kasih saran.
 1. **Participant**: Ya.
 1. **Y**: Bagaimana komentarmu terhadap overall homepage
 1. **P**: Overall simple, UI-nya mirip IOS.
 1. **Y**: Masih ingat homepage pada CI yang dulu?
 1. **P**: Masih
 1. **Y**: Ada yang beda atau tidak?
 1. **P**: Ada font tulisan all tasks nya beda.
 1. **Y**: Ada saran?
 1. **P**: Mana saya tau, kan saya belum pakai fitur2nya.
 1. **Y**: Coba semua aktivitas yang ditampilkan diurutkan berdasarkan nama.
 1. **P**: (Mencoba mengklik semua tombol yang terlihat)
 1. **Y**: Diurutkan berdasarkan namanya, jadi tidak perlu menambah aktivitas lagi.
 1. **P**: Mana saya tau, kan saya belum pakai fitur2nya.
 
 

#### b. Transcript with Participant 2
 - **00:01** 👨‍🔬 You: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 - **00:10** 👨‍💻 Participant: Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
 - **00:17** 👨‍🔬 You: when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
 - **00:25** 👨‍💻 Participant: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis
> Record your observations per prototype screen followed by reference, feedback, incidence, reason, and resolution.

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://www.europassitalian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bravolol-app-screenshot-1-635x1128.png)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants, if any.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2
![Prototype Screen 2](https://www.studiainitalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/free-courses-Learn-Italian-Online.jpg)

 - **Reference**: 
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 2`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 3

 - **Reference**:  
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 3`.
 
 ... and so on ...

## Part B: Prototyping (again)
> Next, you will need to modify your prototype 
> based on the resolutions you have suggested in `Feedback and Incidence Analysis`'s observations.

### Sketch
> Draw a sketch of your prototype that is refined based according to the aforementioned observations on a paper.
> Afterwards, scan the sketch or make the photograph of it and attach it on this report's section.
> Please make sure the any texts on the sketch are readable.

### Design Rationale
> Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the usability evaluation, 
> and how it is reflected in your design.

### High-Fidelity Interactive-Prototype
> Create a high-fidelity interactive-prototype based on the `Sketch` you have drawn.
> You can use any prototyping tools: InVision, Adobe XD, or even Microsoft PowerPoint.
